    Extracts a ruleset model that approximates the given Keras model.

    This algorithm acts in a similar manner to vanilla REM-D but extracts rules
    at a clause-wise level rather than at a term-wise level. This helps the
    model avoiding the exponential explosion of terms that arises from
    distribution term-wise clauses during substitution. It also helps reducing
    the variance in the ruleset sizes while also capturing correlations between
    terms when extracting a ruleset for the overall clause.

    :param keras.Model model: An input instantiated Keras Model object from
        which we will extract rules from.
    :param np.ndarray train_data: A tensor of shape [N, m] with N training
        samples which have m features each.
    :param logging.VerbosityLevel verbosity: The verbosity level to use for this
        function.
    :param str last_activation: Either "softmax" or "sigmoid" indicating which
        activation function should be applied to the last layer of the given
        model if last function is fused with loss. If None, then no activation
        function is applied.
    :param int threshold_decimals: The maximum number of decimals a threshold in
        the generated ruleset may have. If None, then we impose no limit.
    :param bool winnow_intermediate: Whether or not we use winnowing when using
        C5.0 for intermediate hidden layers.
    :param bool winnow_features: Whether or not we use winnowing when extracting
        rules in the features layer.
    :param int min_cases: The minimum number of samples we must have to perform
        a split in a decision tree.
    :param int initial_min_cases: Initial minimum number of samples required for
        a split when calling C5.0 for intermediate hidden layers. This
        value will be linearly annealed given so that the last hidden layer uses
        `initial_min_cases` and the features layer uses `min_cases`.
        If None, then it defaults to min_cases.
    :param int num_workers: Maximum number of working processes to be spanned
        when extracting rules.
    :param List[str] feature_names: List of feature names to be used for
        generating our rule set. If None, then we will assume all input features
        are named `h_0_0`, `h_0_1`, `h_0_2`, etc.
    :param List[str] output_class_names: List of output class names to be used
        for generating our rule set. If None, then we will assume all output
        are named `h_{d+1}_0`, `h_{d+1}_1`, `h_{d+1}_2`, etc where `d` is the
        number of hidden layers in the network.
    :param int trials: The number of sampling trials to use when using bagging
        for C5.0 in intermediate and clause-wise rule extraction.
    :param int block_size: The hidden layer sampling frequency. That is, how
        often will we use a hidden layer in the input network to extract an
        intermediate rule set from it.
    :param Dict[str, Any] kwargs: The keywords arguments used for easier
        integration with other rule extraction methods.

    :returns Ruleset: the set of rules extracted from the given model.
