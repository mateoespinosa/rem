    Extracts a set of rules which imitates given the provided model in a
    pedagogical manner using C5 on the outputs and inputs of the network.

    :param keras.Model model: An input instantiated Keras Model object from
        which we will extract rules from.
    :param np.ndarray train_data: A tensor of shape [N, m] with N training
        samples which have m features each.
    :param logging.VerbosityLevel verbosity: The verbosity level to use for this
        function.
    :param int threshold_decimals: The maximum number of decimals a threshold in
        the generated ruleset may have. If None, then we impose no limit.
    :param bool winnow: Whether or not we use winnowing when using
        C5.0 for rule extraction
    :param int min_cases: The minimum number of samples we must have to perform
        a split in a decision tree.
    :param List[str] feature_names: List of feature names to be used for
        generating our rule set. If None, then we will assume all input features
        are named `h_0_0`, `h_0_1`, `h_0_2`, etc.
    :param List[str] output_class_names: List of output class names to be used
        for generating our rule set. If None, then we will assume all output
        are named `h_{d+1}_0`, `h_{d+1}_1`, `h_{d+1}_2`, etc where `d` is the
        number of hidden layers in the network.
    :param Or[int, float] max_number_of_samples: The maximum number of samples
        to use from the training data. This corresponds to how much we will
        subsample the input training data before using it to construct
        rules. If given as a number in [0, 1], then this represents the fraction
        of the input set which will be used during rule extraction. If None,
        then we will use the entire training set as given.
    :param str tree_extraction_algorithm_name: One of ["C5.0", "CART",
        "random_forest"] indicating which rule extraction algorithm to use for
        extracting rules.
    :param int trials: The number of sampling trials to use when using bagging
        for C5.0 in rule extraction.
    :param int tree_max_depth: max tree depth when using CART or random_forest
        for rule set extraction.
    :param bool ccp_prune: whether or not we do post-hoc CCP prune to CART trees
        if CART is used for rule induction.
    :param int estimators: The number of trees to use if using random_forest
        for rule extraction.
    :param bool regression: whether or not we are dealing with a regression
        task or a classification task.
    :param Dict[str, Any] kwargs: The keywords arguments used for easier
        integration with other rule extraction methods.

    :returns Ruleset: the set of rules extracted from the given model.
